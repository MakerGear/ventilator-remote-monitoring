# Open Source Ventilator Remote Monitor Project

Our goal is to quickly develop a remote monitoring interface for low-cost rapidly-manufactured ventilators currently being developed to provide emergency relief in the Covid-19 Pandemic.  We strive for a lightweight, interoperable, and reliable interface.

This software is currently only a concept - it is neither approved nor intended to be used in any medical setting.

## Live Demo
Check out the [live demo/concept](http:www.ventilatormonitor.com).

## Architecture
- Cloud Server - Ruby on Rails
- Web Application - React / Javascript / Jquery
- Interface Btwn Ventilator & Web Application - Raspberry Pi / Flask / Python
- Ventilator control system - Assumed to be arduino (can interface with others' via USB Serial, SPI, I2C, UART)

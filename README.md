# Open Source Ventilator Remote Monitor Project

Our goal is to quickly develop a remote monitoring interface for low-cost rapidly-manufactured ventilators currently being developed to provide emergency relief in the Covid-19 Pandemic.  We strive for a lightweight, interoperable, and reliable interface.

This software is currently only a concept - it is neither approved nor intended to be used in any medical setting.

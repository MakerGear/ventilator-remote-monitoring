<h3>Welcome to the Open Source Remote Ventilator Monitoring Project</h3>
<h5 style="font-weight: normal;">
	Our goal is to quickly develop a remote monitoring interface for
	low-cost rapidly-manufactured ventilators currently being developed
	to provide emergency relief in the Covid-19 Pandemic. We strive for
	a lightweight, interoperable, and reliable interface.
